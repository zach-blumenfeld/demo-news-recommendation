# News Recommendations In Graph - Demos & Examples
This repository is designed to hold multiple examples of news recommendation in graph leveraging [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
and the [Graph Data Science (GDS) library](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/)

## Current Demos & Examples:
1. `embeddings-webinar-2021-11`: Examples of using multiple types of node embeddings in GDS and exploring the use of 
node embeddings for search recommendation with the Microsoft [MIND-Small Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/#:~:text=name%20this%20dataset-,MIND-small,-.%20The%20training%20and).
2. `mind-large-collab-filtering`: Exploring graph based Collaborative Filtering (CF) on the Microsoft 
[MIND-Large Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/).
